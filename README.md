# arduino-thermostat
This project turns an inverter on/off based on the temperature of an AC mini fridge to save power in camper vans.
## Motivation
When using AC refrigerators in camper vans instead of DC ones, most of the wasted power is from idling the inverter for long periods of time. This project solves that problem.
